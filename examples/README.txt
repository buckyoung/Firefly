# To add a new example #

1. Create a new .js file in this directory
2. In the file, add a module to FFExamples, like: "FFExamples.risk = {}" (will need to define an "initialize" function to hook into the Firefly engine)
3. Update all-examples.js to include the new file (In the form of "category - filenameWithoutExtension")
