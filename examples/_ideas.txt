# Example Ideas #

1)
"Wizarding World" -- imagine a bunch of dementors swimming around the scene and then a 
patronous fires from the end of a wand and parts the sea of dementors
- black cells that want to fill in the whole map and move randomly
- they keep away from any "light" cells that come near
would essentially create a flocking pattern where one cell-state flock-avoids another cell-state

2)
create a FIREFLY example game! some kind of blinking of lights on and off 

3) 
do the ant... 
"Interesting behavior follows: a single ant, starting with all cells in to-left state, has a more or less symmetric trajectory in the first 500 steps; then it goes seemingly randomly for about 10,000 steps, until it suddenly starts building an infinite diagonal “highway” (a periodic motion with drift)."

4)
after the ant, do a turmite

# Engine Ideas #

1)
Refactor firefly-world to use a shader instead... could implement an interface to run both then swap over?
